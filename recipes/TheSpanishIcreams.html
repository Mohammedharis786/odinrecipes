    <h1>Description

    </h1>
    <p>Neapolitan ice cream is a staple of the freezer aisle. Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry are served together â€”
        but not mixed or swirled, no, instead, these three flavors are presented in three perfect sections without any
        packaging dividing them</p>
    <h1>Ingriedients</h1>

    <h1>preparation</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Mix together and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the heavy whipping cream to a large bowl. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to whip the cream until stiff
            peaks form. This should only take a few minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the whipped cream to the sweetened condensed milk mixture. Carefully fold the whipped cream into the
            sweetened condensed milk mixture. Try to keep the mixture light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into three separate bowls. </li>
        <li>Leave one bowl as is (that's the vanilla). In the second bowl, stir in the cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>In the last bowl, add the powdered freeze-dried strawberries and a few drops of red food coloring until you
            get a light pink ice cream.</li>
        
    </ol>
