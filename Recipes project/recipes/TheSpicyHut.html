    <h1>Tomato Butter-Roast chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/tomato.png" alt="chicken">
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>I am firmly in the camp that everyone should know how to properly roast a chicken, and this should be the recipe
        you try. Tomato butter works wonders on chicken. Not only does it keep the bird moist, but the healthy dose of
        tomato paste brings a slightly sweet, umami acidity, which chicken could often use</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>ground cumin</li>
